# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

``` You can install packages using
    yarn install

    Compile: yarn hardhat compile

    Deploy: yarn hardhat deploy

    Test: yarn hardhat test
```
